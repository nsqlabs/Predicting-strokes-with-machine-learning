# Predicting-strokes-with-machine-learning
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.  In this project, we will predict whether a patient will have a heart stroke or not based on his/her comorbidities, work, and lifestyle.
